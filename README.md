# Data Preprocessing
1. Download WESAD https://ubi29.informatik.uni-siegen.de/usi/data_wesad.html
2. Download FOG https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/r8gmbtv7w2/3
3. Download ISRUC https://sleeptight.isr.uc.pt/?page_id=48
4. Go to data preprocessing directory `cd dataset_preprocessing`
5. Update `wesad_path` in `make_WESAD.py` and `fog_path` in `make_FOG.py` and `isruc_path` in `make_ISRUC.py`
6. Preprocess WESAD `python make_WESAD.py` and FOG `python make_FOG.py` and ISRUC `python make_ISRUC.py`

# Download foundation model checkpoints
1. Download `labram-base.pth` to `LaBraM_anonymous/checkpoints/` from https://github.com/935963004/LaBraM/tree/main/checkpoints
2. Download `hubert_ecg_small.pt` to `HuBERT_ECG_anonymous/code/checkpoint/` from https://huggingface.co/Edoardo-BS/HuBERT-ECG-SSL-Pretrained/tree/main
3. Download `papagei_s.pt` to `papagei_anonymous/weights/` from https://zenodo.org/records/13983110
4. Download `normwear_last_checkpoint-15470-correct.pth` to `NormWear_anonymous` from https://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha

# Experiments
1. Bash scripts for each of the six knowledge transfer directions are available under `bash_scripts`.

# Note
1. All logs will be stored under `/users/anonymous/BioX-Bridge`
2. All checkpoints will be stored under `/data/anonymous/BioX-Bridge/`
3. Special thanks to the authors of ECG-FM, HuBERT-ECG, LaBraM, PaPaGei, ECG-DualNet, and NormWear that served as the building blocks for this repository.
